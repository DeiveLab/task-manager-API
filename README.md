# task-manager-API
My first Node API - this project really changed my understanding of back-end development.
The objective of this API is to create an enviroment where users can create and manipulate tasks.
With this project I was able to learn and practice many things:
- Express: created routers and used middleware to provide authentication
- MongoDB: applied Mongoose to stablish a database and configure users and tasks, used middlewares to change saving and deleting behavior
- Postman: used to test the routes
- Robo3T and MongoDB Compass: view created collections
- NPM packages: jsonwebtokens(authentication), validator(validate email), multer(receive uploads), sharp(change images on upload)
- Git: code versioning
- Heroku: deployment and production
- CRUD
